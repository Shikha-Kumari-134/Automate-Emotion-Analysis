# Automate-Emotion-Analysis
In this project, I've developed an automated system that analyzes emotions from textual data such as tweets or messages. The system utilizes NLP techniques, sentiment analysis, and LSTM-based deep learning models to classify emotions accurately.

**Key Features:**

✅ Preprocessing of Text Data (Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Stemming)

✅ Training a Deep Learning Model using TensorFlow and Keras

✅ Emotion Classification (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry) with High Accuracy

✅ Visualizing Emotion Distribution in the Dataset

**Check out the code snippets below for insights into the project's implementation:**

Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, and Stemming

Model Development: Sequential LSTM model with Embedding Layer

Training the Model with Training Data and Evaluating Performance


**Run the application on your localHost:**
1. First clone my repo using git clone command
2. Unzip and Open folder in VS Code
3. Fire up the terminal and write python app.py and Press Enter
4. Now, the application is running on your local host.
5. Feel free to use it accordingly.
